The department is considering implementing an algorithmic system to identify communities that should receive priority for social service funding and outreach programs. Your supervisor has asked you to evaluate the quality and reliability of available census data to inform this decision.\n\nDrawing on our Week 2 discussion of algorithmic bias, you need to assess not just what the data shows, but how reliable it is and what communities might be affected by data quality issues.\n\n## Learning Objectives\n\n- Apply dplyr functions to real census data for policy analysis\n- Evaluate data quality using margins of error \n- Connect technical analysis to algorithmic decision-making\n- Identify potential equity implications of data reliability issues\n- Create professional documentation for policy stakeholders\n\n# Part 1: Portfolio Integration\n\n# Setup\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_state <- \"PA\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n**State Selection:** I have chosen **Pennsylvania** for this analysis because: Pennsylvania has a diverse mix of urban, suburban, and rural counties, providing an excellent opportunity to examine how census data quality varies across different community types and population densities.\n\n# Part 2: County-Level Resource Assessment\n\n## 2.1 Data Retrieval\n\n**Your Task:** Use `get_acs()` to retrieve county-level data for your chosen state.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: county level\n- Variables: median household income (B19013_001) and total population (B01003_001)  \n- Year: 2022\n- Survey: acs5\n- Output format: wide\n\n**Hint:** Remember to give your variables descriptive names using the `variables = c(name = \"code\")` syntax.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Write your get_acs() code here\ncounty_data <- get_acs(\n  geography = \"county\",\n  variables = c(\n    median_income = \"B19013_001\",\n    total_population = \"B01003_001\"\n  ),\n  state = my_state,\n  year = 2022,\n  survey = \"acs5\",\n  output = \"wide\"\n)\n\n# Clean the county names to remove state name and \"County\" \n# Hint: use mutate() with str_remove()\ncounty_data <- county_data %>%\n  mutate(\n    county_name = str_remove(NAME, \", Pennsylvania\"),\n    county_name = str_remove(county_name, \" County\")\n  )\n\n# Display the first few rows\nkable(head(county_data),\n      caption = \"County-Level Data Sample\",\n      digits = 0)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: County-Level Data Sample\n\n|GEOID |NAME                           | median_incomeE| median_incomeM| total_populationE| total_populationM|county_name |\n|:-----|:------------------------------|--------------:|--------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|:-----------|\n|42001 |Adams County, Pennsylvania     |          78975|           3334|            104604|                NA|Adams       |\n|42003 |Allegheny County, Pennsylvania |          72537|            869|           1245310|                NA|Allegheny   |\n|42005 |Armstrong County, Pennsylvania |          61011|           2202|             65538|                NA|Armstrong   |\n|42007 |Beaver County, Pennsylvania    |          67194|           1531|            167629|                NA|Beaver      |\n|42009 |Bedford County, Pennsylvania   |          58337|           2606|             47613|                NA|Bedford     |\n|42011 |Berks County, Pennsylvania     |          74617|           1191|            428483|                NA|Berks       |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## 2.2 Data Quality Assessment\n\n**Your Task:** Calculate margin of error percentages and create reliability categories.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Calculate MOE percentage: (margin of error / estimate) * 100\n- Create reliability categories:\n  -

These counties would be poorly served by algorithms that rely heavily on median income data, as the estimates are less reliable and could lead to misallocation of resources. The higher uncertainty is likely due to smaller population sizes in these counties, which makes it more difficult to obtain precise statistical estimates through sampling methods.\n\n# Part 3: Neighborhood-Level Analysis\n\n## 3.1 Focus Area Selection\n\n**Your Task:** Select 2-3 counties from your reliability analysis for detailed tract-level study.\n\n**Strategy:** Choose counties that represent different reliability levels (e.g., 1 high confidence, 1 moderate, 1 low confidence) to compare how data quality varies.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Use filter() to select 2-3 counties from your county_reliability data\n# Store the selected counties in a variable called selected_counties\n\n# Get one county from each reliability category for comparison\nselected_counties <- county_reliability %>%\n  group_by(reliability_category) %>%\n  slice(1) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  select(GEOID, county_name, median_incomeE, moe_percentage, reliability_category)\n\n# Display the selected counties with their key characteristics\n# Show: county name, median income, MOE percentage, reliability category\nkable(selected_counties,\n      col.names = c(\"GEOID\", \"County\", \"Median Income\", \"MOE %\", \"Reliability\"),\n      caption = \"Selected Counties for Detailed Analysis\",\n      digits = 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nTable: Selected Counties for Detailed Analysis\n\n|GEOID |County  | Median Income| MOE %|Reliability         |\n|:-----|:-------|-------------:|-----:|:-------------------|\n|42001 |Adams   |         78975|  4.22|High Confidence     |\n|42023 |Cameron |         46186|  5.64|Moderate Confidence |\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Comment on the output:** The selected counties represent a good range of data reliability levels - Adams County with high confidence (4.22% MOE) and Cameron County with moderate confidence (5.64% MOE). This selection allows us to compare how data quality issues manifest differently across different types of Pennsylvania communities, from more populous areas to smaller rural counties.\n\n## 3.2 Tract-Level Demographics\n\n**Your Task:** Get demographic data for census tracts in your selected counties.\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Geography: tract level\n- Variables: white alone (B03002_003), Black/African American (B03002_004), Hispanic/Latino (B03002_012), total population (B03002_001)\n- Use the same state and year as before\n- Output format: wide\n- **Challenge:** You'll need county codes, not names.

By examining separate MOE flags for each demographic group, we can see that data reliability issues are not uniformly distributed. The analysis shows that tracts with high MOE for specific demographic groups tend to have different characteristics - for example, tracts with high MOE for Black population estimates may have very low Black population percentages, while tracts with high MOE for Hispanic population estimates may have different demographic compositions. This granular analysis allows for more targeted policy interventions, as we can identify which specific demographic groups face data quality challenges in which communities, rather than treating all high-MOE tracts as equivalent.\n\n\n# Part 5: Policy Recommendations\n\n## 5.1 Analysis Integration and Professional Summary\n\n**Your Task:** Write an executive summary that integrates findings from all four analyses.\n\n**Executive Summary Requirements:**\n1. **Overall Pattern Identification**: What are the systematic patterns across all your analyses?\n2. **Equity Assessment**: Which communities face the greatest risk of algorithmic bias based on your findings?\n3. **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying factors drive both data quality issues and bias risk?\n4. **Strategic Recommendations**: What should the Department implement to address these systematic issues?\n\n**Executive Summary:**\n\nMy analysis of Pennsylvania's census data reveals systematic patterns in data quality that pose significant challenges for algorithmic decision-making in social service allocation. At the county level, I found that 85.1% of Pennsylvania's 67 counties have high confidence data (MOE < 5%) for median income, while 14.9% fall into the moderate confidence category (MOE 5-10%). Notably, no counties reached the low confidence threshold (MOE > 10%), indicating that county-level income data is generally reliable across Pennsylvania. However, the variation in data quality is not random - counties with higher MOE percentages tend to be smaller, rural communities such as Forest, Sullivan, and Cameron counties.\n\nThe tract-level demographic analysis reveals more concerning patterns for algorithmic equity. All 29 census tracts examined in my selected counties showed high MOE issues (>15%) for at least one demographic variable, particularly for Black and Hispanic population estimates. This finding is especially troubling because demographic data is crucial for ensuring equitable service delivery and identifying communities that may face systemic disadvantages. The tract-level analysis shows average populations of around 3,763 people, with demographics averaging 88.7% white, 1.2% Black, and 6.8% Hispanic, suggesting that minority communities may be systematically underrepresented in reliable data.\n\nThe equity implications of these findings are profound and create multiple layers of algorithmic bias risk. Communities most likely to experience data quality issues - rural areas, smaller populations, and areas with minority populations - may also be those most in need of social services but least likely to receive them through algorithmic allocation systems. This creates a systematic bias where algorithms trained on unreliable data could perpetuate or exacerbate existing inequalities. The combination of small population sizes and demographic diversity appears to compound data reliability issues, suggesting that the most vulnerable communities face the greatest risk of being poorly served by algorithmic systems.\n\nGiven these systematic challenges, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services must implement a tiered, equity-conscious approach to algorithmic decision-making. Rather than applying uniform algorithmic criteria across all communities, the department should develop differentiated strategies that provide additional oversight for moderate-confidence counties and alternative assessment methods for areas with known demographic data limitations. This includes establishing enhanced monitoring protocols, manual review processes for high-stakes decisions, and partnerships with community organizations to supplement census data in areas where it may be unreliable. Such an approach ensures that algorithmic efficiency enhances rather than undermines equitable service delivery across Pennsylvania's diverse communities.\n\n## 6.3 Specific Recommendations\n\n**Your

implementation:** The 57 counties with high confidence data (MOE < 5%) including major population centers like Allegheny, Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, and Chester counties are appropriate for immediate algorithmic implementation. These counties have large populations, stable demographic patterns, and reliable census estimates that minimize the risk of algorithmic bias. Their robust data quality allows algorithms to make accurate assessments and resource allocations with minimal human oversight required.\n\n2. **Counties requiring additional oversight:** The 10 counties with moderate confidence data (MOE 5-10%) including Forest, Sullivan, Union, Montour, Elk, Warren, Carbon, Snyder, Cameron, and Greene require enhanced monitoring protocols. These counties should implement quarterly outcome reviews, establish appeal processes for algorithmic decisions, conduct periodic manual audits of allocation patterns, and maintain enhanced documentation of decision rationales. Additionally, these counties should have lower thresholds for triggering manual review of high-stakes decisions.\n\n3. **Counties needing alternative approaches:** While my analysis found no counties with low confidence data at the county level, the tract-level analysis reveals that demographic data quality issues require special attention across all counties. For areas with significant demographic uncertainty, alternative approaches should include: partnering with local community organizations for supplementary data collection, implementing mandatory manual review for decisions affecting minority communities, developing alternative indicators beyond census data (such as school enrollment data or local administrative records), and establishing community feedback mechanisms to validate algorithmic outcomes.\n\n## Questions for Further Investigation\n\n1. **Geographic Clustering of Data Quality Issues:** Are the counties with moderate confidence data (Forest, Sullivan, Cameron, etc.) geographically clustered in specific regions of Pennsylvania, and do they share common characteristics such as rural designation, distance from urban centers, or economic base? Understanding spatial patterns could help identify systematic factors affecting census data collection and inform targeted data quality improvement efforts.\n\n2. **Demographic Data Reliability Across Different Community Types:** How does the reliability of demographic data vary between urban, suburban, and rural census tracts, and are there specific thresholds of population size or demographic diversity below which data becomes systematically unreliable? This analysis could help establish evidence-based guidelines for when additional data collection or alternative assessment methods are needed.\n\n3. **Impact of Data Quality on Service Delivery Outcomes:** How do current social service allocation patterns correlate with data quality levels, and are communities with less reliable census data currently underserved relative to their documented needs? This longitudinal analysis could provide evidence of existing algorithmic bias and help quantify the potential impact of implementing data quality-aware decision systems.\n\n# Technical Notes\n\n**Data Sources:** \n- U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey 2018-2022 5-Year Estimates\n- Retrieved via tidycensus R package on 09/22/2025\n\n**Reproducibility:** \n- All analysis conducted in R version 4.5.1\n- Census API key required for replication (obtain from https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html)\n- Complete code and documentation available at: [https://musa-5080-fall-2025.github.io/portfolio-setup-FANYANG0304/]\n\n**Methodology Notes:**\nCounty selection for detailed tract-level analysis was based on a stratified sampling approach, choosing counties from different reliability categories to ensure representation across data quality levels. Only Adams and Cameron counties were ultimately analyzed at the tract level due to the moderate confidence category having limited representation. MOE percentage calculations follow standard Census Bureau methodology (margin of error divided by estimate, multiplied by 100). Reliability categories were defined using commonly accepted thresholds in demographic analysis: High Confidence (<5%), Moderate Confidence (5-10%), and Low Confidence (>10%).\n\n**Limitations:**\nThis analysis is limited to Pennsylvania and may not generalize to other states with different demographic or geographic characteristics. The tract-level analysis was constrained to only two counties, which may not fully represent the diversity of data quality issues across all Pennsylvania communities. The assignment focuses on specific demographic and income variables; other social and economic indicators may show different reliability patterns. The analysis uses a single time period (2022 ACS 5-year estimates) and does not account for temporal variations in data quality. Additionally, extreme MOE values (including infinite values) in some tract-level demographic estimates may indicate fundamental data collection challenges that require further investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Submission Checklist\n\nBefore submitting your portfolio link on Canvas:\n\n- [x] All code chunks run without errors\n- [x] All \"[Fill this in]\" prompts have been completed\n- [x] Tables are properly formatted and readable\n- [x] Executive summary addresses all four required components\n- [x] Portfolio navigation includes this assignment\n- [x] Census API key is properly set \n- [x] Document renders correctly to HTML",
